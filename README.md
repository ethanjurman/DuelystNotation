## Use Case
This should help people discuss board state without having to be very wordy
(i.e. "place the minion on the top right square near the middle mana tile" vs
"place the minion on d6"). Ideally helpful for commentators, and streamers who
like discussion of the board state.

## Using the extension
**Push 'n' to toggle it while in game.** By clicking the icon in the app bar
you can adjust the settings (to accommodate different screen sizes and
preferences). It's saved to localStorage so the preferences should keep for a
while (unless you do a hard refresh)- either way it should be easy to modify by
typing in numbers or using arrow keys on the input fields.
